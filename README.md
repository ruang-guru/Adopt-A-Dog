# Adopt-A-Dog

Hello, candidate! Today we are going to make a simple app to help in the process of adopting a dog. Your mission here is to make a display of dogs put up for adoption. The data are provided and what you need to do is making the layouts. In this case, you are expected to differentiate the display between small dogs and big dogs, because small home owners might want to scan for small dogs, and you can help through providing visual cues!

Provided in this project is the code as a base where you add your code. In the process, you are free to add libraries of your choosing, and adding or removing anything. As for layout, don't worry so much about precision, be it color, dimension, etc. Improvisation is welcome, too.

Expected result is as below ![here](https://github.com/ruang-guru/Adopt-A-Dog/blob/master/display.png)
